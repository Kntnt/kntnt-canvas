== Description ==

Kntnt Canvas is a WordPress block theme that enables full site editing (FSE).

Use it on its own or as a parent theme for [Kntnt Canvas Child](https://github.com/Kntnt/kntnt-canvas-child).

Kntnt Canvas is developed to accomplish three objectives:

1. It should be a beautiful and usable theme out of the box.
2. It should serve as a starting point from which more customized themes can be developed in the WordPress site editor.
3. It should not reset the browser's built-in style sheets or override WordPress default CSS unless absolutely necessary. This is in order (i) to make it easier for developers to create custom CSS, (ii) to load as little CSS as possible, and (iii) to be as robust as possible against future changes and additions to the WordPress CSS.
